                    <p>The world is progressing towards greater technical heights and it is of utmost importance to know the basics in order to delve deeper into the realms of electrical and electronics engineering. IETE organises the Circuit Logic and Design [CLD] Workshop for the students of all branches with the aim of introducing them to the world of electrical and electronics. The workshop is interactive and is aimed at introducing basic circuit components and their practical utility, how to recognise various circuit elements and how to know their ratings for their proper operation. Simulation of circuits on software is also taken up in this workshop. Implementation of various analog and digital circuits using both hardware and software is done. Internal circuitry of breadboard and various other circuit boards like veroboard is also taught. Implementation of various logic gates and circuits on breadboard is done for participants to gain hands on experience of various instruments and components. Thus, for the beginner the CLD workshop is a golden tool to learn in a fun and interactive way and to build a strong basic of electronics and electrical.</p>
