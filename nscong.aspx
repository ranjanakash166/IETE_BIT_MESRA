                    <p>The Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers (IETE) organized its first National Student Congress (NSC) in association with IETE Student Chapter of Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. The two-day programme aims at giving a platform to students to interact with specialists of latest technology in the area of electrical, electronics and communication. Apart from students of BIT Mesra, other UG/PG students from premier institutes like NIT Rourkela, NIT Jamshedpur, BIT Sindri, HBTI Kanpur, Anna University and GBTU Lucknow also participatesin the congress. S S Akhtar, deputy registrar of BIT Mesra, said the National Student Congress provides a golden opportunity to collaborate and interact purposefully with like-minded people from various fields. "With the aim of providing the students an insight into the technical realms of the modern world and finding solutions to the daily challenges faced in these fields, the event's focus will be to equip its participants with the knowledge of the present technical scenario," he said, adding that the sharp scientific environment of the Congress will ensure that the attendees get maximum exposure in terms of learning and sharing their own thoughts. Some of the experts invited to share their experiences include Vishnu Dixit, divisional manager of Tata Motors, who will speak on the requirement of engineering expertise in the industry. Pratyush Anand, engineering specialist at ST Microelectronics will deliver his speech on some of the ground-breaking inventions in the field of communication software. "He has specialization in USBs, PCIes, ARMs & Linux and a profound command on debugging; this ex-DRDO employ has been associated with development of Bus Interface Unit of Software Radio, Sts WUSB DWA dongle," Akhtar said. Vikrant Nanda, member executive body of IETE, BIT chapter, said one of the workshops will be hosted by Texas Instruments, which is a major semi-conductor manufacturer and has a strong university program all over the world. "Cranes Software International Limited is the authorized partner for Texas Instruments University program. The workshop on Texas Instruments Microcontrollers & Analog Portfolio is devoted to deeper understanding of system design, architecture, features, peripherals and development tools by highlighting their key application areas, which includes wireless sensor networks, medical development tools, and digital power & control applications," he said, adding that students will be benefited by the session.</p>
