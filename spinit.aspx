SPIN IT AROUND was an enjoyable event conducted by the IETE club of BIT MESRA which took place in room no 233 between 3:00pm to 5:00 pm. The event was about creating your own dialogues for a given mute video. A mute video would be shown to each team and its members should put up their own dialogues which should bear no resemblance to the situation shown in the video. The spontaneity of the participants and the originality of the idea were the key points that were being put to test. The first position was grabbed by the team Powerpuf pandas, the second position by the team Assasins and the third position by the team Trespassers.
